Learning ADA

Ada's philosophy is different from most other languages. Underlying Ada's
design are principles that include the following:
• Readability is more important than conciseness. Syntactically this shows
through the fact that keywords are preferred to symbols, that no keyword is an abbreviation, etc.
• Very strong typing. It is very easy to introduce new types in Ada, with
the benefit of preventing data usage errors.
– It is similar to many functional languages in that regard, except that
the programmer has to be much more explicit about typing in Ada,
because there is almost no type inference.
• Explicit is better than implicit. Although this is a Python
commandment, Ada takes it way further than any language we know of:
– There is mostly no structural typing, and most types need to be explicitly
named by the programmer.
– As previously said, there is mostly no type inference.
– Semantics are very well defined, and undefined behavior is limited to an
absolute minimum.
– The programmer can generally give a lot of information about what their
program means to the compiler (and other programmers). This allows the
compiler to be extremely helpful (read: strict) with the programmer.
